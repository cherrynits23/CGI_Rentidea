I'm excited to share the completion of the RentIdea project, where we've created a dynamic platform for buying and selling products online. Our team utilized a comprehensive stack of front-end and back-end technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

For the backend, we implemented MongoDB as our database solution, providing robust and scalable storage capabilities. On the server-side, ASP.NET Core and C# were employed to handle the business logic and data processing efficiently.

On the front end, we crafted an engaging user interface using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and AngularJS. These technologies allowed us to deliver a modern and responsive design, enhancing usability across devices.

Ensuring secure authentication was paramount, so we integrated Kafka for authentication processes, bolstering the platform's security measures.
For deployment, Docker proved instrumental, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across different environments.

Incorporating payment functionality was essential, and for this, we integrated Razorpay for seamless transactions. Additionally, we implemented a subscription model using points, providing users with flexible and rewarding options for accessing premium features on the platform.

Overall, RentIdea represents a culmination of cutting-edge technologies and meticulous development, offering users a seamless and enjoyable online market
